As you stand panting on the deck of your sloop, the wind blows through your hair and the salt ocean spray smatters against your cheeks. Your greatest rival, the nefarious pirate Sinclair, lies dead at your feet, your cutlass portruding from his chest. Crouching down next to him, you search his scarlet coat for whatever secrets he might have. Fortune favors the bold, or whoever won the duel anyway. As you dig through his pockets, you unearth a scroll of parchment, sealed by a golden wax emblem. You tear open the seal and pour over the scroll's contents. According to the document, there lies a grand treasure somewhere in the great ASCII-sea, just waiting to be discovered by a swasbuckling scoundrel such as yourself. The treasure supposedly lies buried on an island guarded by a great beast, but you won't let that deter you, right? If you were to find this magnificent treasure trove, you would be known as the wealthiest and most powerful pirate in the entire ASCII-sea! So, what are you waiting for? Yank your cutlass out from the dead guy, unceremoniously dump his body into the sea and set sail!

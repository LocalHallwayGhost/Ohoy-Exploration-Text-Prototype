In this game, you will sail your sloop around the ASCII-Sea, using the Arrow-keys. When you near an island, you can Port at that island, by pressing the P-key. Each island houses a ferocious guardian, that you must fight using your array of weaponry. If you manage to defeat them, they will grant you a clue that will help you find the treasure island. Clues will be stored in your Journal and can be accessed by pressing the J-key. Now, get out there and find that treasure!
